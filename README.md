## Adding a conference

All conferences are stored in [JSON files](https://github.com/tech-conferences/conference-data/tree/master/conferences), sorted by topics and years. All data is open source and crowd sourced by the community. Whether added directly [from the website](https://confs.tech/conferences/new) by conference organizers or through pull requests.
